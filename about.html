            <h2>Let Me Introduce Myself!</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Kiley and I am 22 years old. I am originally from Bend, Oregon but am currently living in Boise, Idaho for school! I am studying Integrated Media and Strategic Communications with a minor in Computer Science at Boise State University. I plan on graduating in May 2022!<br>
            <br>After graduation, I will be moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota because I landed an amazing internship as a web designer for RBC! I can't wait to gain real world experience while putting my knowledge of both media and computer science to use!<br>
            <br>Throughout my college experience, I have learned so much! Not only have I gained lots of academic knowledge, but I have learned so much about study methods, friendships and relationships, staying active, fun and affordable activities in Boise, and how to manage living away from home while attending a university. I hope this blog can help guide you on your journey through college!</p>
