            <h1>Prepare To Be Productive</h1>
            <p>Up to this point, my blog has mainly consisted of the fun and exciting parts of college. Leaving home for the first time, meeting new friends, discovering fun and affordable activities. Don't get me wrong, all these things are a huge part of the overall college experience, but what is the main reason you decided to enroll in a university? To learn! We all attend college so we can earn a degree, hopefully get a job after graduation, and to improve our knowledge in not only our specified field of study but all around.</p>
            <p>In my experience, the transition from a high school learning environment to a college one was pretty difficult. In the beginning, I felt like I had so much free time. I loved having only 2-3 classes a day and then the rest of the day was spent however I wanted, which usually consisted of meeting up with friends or spending way too much time in the dining hall. I quickly learned that even though I wasn't in class, there was a lot of work that needed to be accomplished on my own time. I struggled to find the motivation to get my work done due to the freedom of not having my parents nagging me and the distraction of friends and roommates. While there are weeks where I still lack motivation, I have found study tips that have positively impacted my work ethic and I want to share them with you!</p>
            <h4>DON'T DO HOMEWORK IN BED</h4>
            <p>If you only take one thing away from this post, I hope this is what it is. I seriously cannot stress enough how much of an impact this had on my studying. I used to always lay in bed while doing my work and I would get distracted, my productivity levels were low, and I would literally fall asleep in the middle of doing an assignment. Your bed is not meant to be a workplace. Your bed is where you sleep. There are actually several studies that prove the negative affects of doing homework in bed. If this is something you need more convincing of or just want to learn more, you can read more here! </p>
            <h4>GO TO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS NATURAL LIGHTING AND MINIMAL DISTRACTIONS</h4>
            <p>Now that you promise to never do homework in bed again, where should you study? For me, finding a quiet place with lots of natural lighting and minimal distractions helped me a lot. Most of the time, this would mean leaving my dorm, apartment, or house to go to a completely different environment. The minimal distractions is self explanatory, but why is natural light important? Well, in my experience, natural lighting seems to elevate my productivity levels much higher than if I were to study under florescent lights or a dark room. It also boosts my mood which definitely helps when I am doing something that I would rather not be doing (aka homework). I'm not sure if this is a proven fact or if it just works for me but definitely try it out if you haven't before. My favorite place to study on campus my freshman year was the ILC (Interactive Learning Center) because of the large windows. Now, I spend most of my time in the Computer Science Building downtown on the third floor because it also has huge windows plus an amazing view of downtown. </p>
            <h4>FIND A STUDY BUDDY</h4>
            <p>Having a friend or a peer to study with is another major thing that helps me stay focused. It is great when you meet people in your classes and you can work on assignments together. They might be able to help you when you get stuck or explain a concept from a different perspective that allows you to understand it better. Even if you aren't in the same courses, being with someone who is accomplishing their work makes you much more motivated to finish yours. My main study buddy is not even in the same major as I am, but we like working together because we are able to hold each other accountable and it's also just comforting to have someone present that's also working hard.</p>
            <h4>PUT YOUR PHONE ON SILENCE</h4>
            <p>I actually just recently started doing this and oh. my. gosh. I'm upset I haven't been doing this longer. I was a sucker for saying I was going to take a 10 minute break to scroll through Instagram and then 3 hours later I am watching a video of a dog doing a handstand. Having notifications constantly making your phone vibrate and light up is such a huge distraction. You can never fully get engaged in what you are working on. It also helps if you put your phone somewhere that you can't even see it. Out of sight, out of mind!</p>
            <h4>TAKE 15 MINUTE STUDY BREAKS</h4>
            <p>It is easy to get overwhelmed and frustrated when you have been working on a project for several hours. Especially when you run into an issue that you just can't figure out how to solve. I used to call my mom having meltdowns after studying for hours and every time she would tell me "Take a deep breath, go get a snack and some fresh air, and then get back to it. You got this!" And believe it or not, I ALWAYS felt better after I did this. Taking some time to clear your head will make you feel refreshed and might even help you recognize the issue you were encountered with. (But don't go on your phone during this break or you will be playing a dangerous game).</p>
            <h4>GO TO TUTORING AND OFFICE HOURS</h4>
            <p>I know everyone says it but actually do it. I didn't start doing this until my junior year of college because I thought it was embarrassing. I can assure you it's not though. You won't know how to do everything on your own, so rather than letting it affect your grade, don't be afraid to ask for help. The great thing about college is that there are so many free resources to help you succeed. And, when professors see that you are putting in effort to get help, they will be a lot more likely to round your grade up. It could even possibly lead to an amazing letter of recommendation!</p>
            <p>Everyone has their preferred study methods but this is what works for me! Let me know your favorite study tips and how they have positively impacted you! If you are struggling with your productivity, I definitely recommend trying these things and you might be shocked by just how much they help.</p>
