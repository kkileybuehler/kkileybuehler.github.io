            <h1>Making A Home Away From Home</h1>
            <p>Leaving home for the first time can be one of the most terrifying yet exciting things to happen in your lifetime. Trust me - I've been through it! Although this was nearly four years ago, I can still vividly remember the week leading up to when it was finally time to leave for college. I was strangely calm, considering I was leaving behind all my friends and family and moving to a new state where I knew absolutely no one. It almost didn't feel real. Even though I was extremely excited for my new adventure, I think part of me was in denial and didn't want to believe I was moving.</p>
            <p>There were two times where I felt a major wave of emotions. The first wave was the night before I left. It was my going away party when all my friends were beginning to leave. It finally occurred to me that we were all growing up and going our separate ways. Although I was convinced we would talk and text frequently, I finally recognized that I wouldn't be able to see them every week. </p>
            <p>The second wave happened in Boise. My parents had just finished helping me move into my dorm room and it was time for them to head back home. This was it. I was officially on my own. I no longer had my parents to explore the city or grab food with. I didn't know a single person or how to navigate campus. I already felt homesick and was very intimidated, to say the least.</p>
            <p>When I look back at that time of my life, I can now recognize some things I did that helped me become more comfortable with my new home and surroundings. So, I want to share some of these things with you in hopes to help ease the transition!</p>
            <h4>Make Your Room Feel Like Home</h4>
            <p>The first thing that made me feel more comfortable was decorating my room to feel cozy and homey. Automatically, this made me feel like I wasn't an outsider and this was where I belonged. I hung up lights and photos of my friends and family. I brought pillows and cozy blankets. I put up some of my art work that was originally in my bedroom back home. I even bought some plants to make it feel more lively. It was a simple room but it immediately made me feel much more thrilled about accepting that this was my new room. I mean, would you rather live in a cold and plain room or a room that brings you joy and makes you feel at home?</p>
            <h4>Do Not Stay In Your Room</h4>
            <p>Now that you love your newly decorated room, get the heck out of there! I know you're probably saying to yourself, "I don't know anyone" or "I don't know my way around campus". That's okay! Everyone is in the exact same boat as you. I know this is overstated but it's because it's true! Most people are going to be just as nervous as you.</p>
            <p>I know how nerve-wracking it is - especially if you wouldn't consider yourself an extrovert. This is one of the most important times to step outside of your comfort zone and I can guarantee you will be happy that you did. Talk to anyone you see and begin by just saying hi and introducing yourself! I bet you will make them happy and now you already have a connection with somebody. </p>
            <p>For me, I was too scared to walk around campus by myself, so I just wandered around my new dorm building. There were people sitting on the couch that I started a conversation with and they ended up inviting me to a soccer game that same day. I also met a girl who invited me to go boating that weekend with a group of her friends! It is so much easier than you would expect to meet people and make friends as long as you do the hardest step by leaving your room.</p>
            <h4>Go To Events</h4>
            <p>Universities do an amazing job at throwing special events for new students. There are movie nights, dance parties, game nights, and so much more! Football games and other sporting events are also crazy fun! It is the perfect time to meet people, have fun, be a part of a new community, and show your school spirit. Chances are, the people you made connections with earlier will also be attending. So, get a group together and have fun! Some of my best college memories are at these special events. I also met some of my best friends by going to an event with a girl I had met earlier and she ended up introducing me to them.</p>
            <h4>Join Clubs</h4>
            <p>Lastly, I highly recommend joining some sort of club. There is such a wide variety of clubs that there is bound to be something for everyone. They range from sporting clubs, to video game clubs, to foreign clubs, greek life, chess club, and probably a lot more that I didn't even know about. Here is a link to all the clubs Boise State has to offer so definitely check it out!</p>
            <p>Greek life is probably the most popular and I know a lot of people that loved their time in a sorority or fraternity. I decided not to go that route but it is a great way to make friends!</p> 
            <p>My favorite thing is definitely intramural sports. I still make teams and compete as a senior! They have nearly any sport you could think of and you don't even have to have any prior experience! There are non-competitive leagues for every sport and so it is just a really fun time to hang out with friends while staying active.</p>
            <p>While doing these things may be scary or uncomfortable, it is so worth it. You will meet the most amazing people and experience things that you never would have gotten to living at home. For a lot of people, this may be your first taste of freedom and independence. Use it to your advantage! I grew so much as a person my freshman year of college and it was all because I was constantly stepping outside of my comfort zone, meeting new people, and saying yes to new experiences!</p>
            <p>There is a quote I like by Brian Tracy that states "Move out of your comfort zone. You can only grow if you are willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new." I think this is a good reminder, not only for new college students, but for everyone! I am moving to Minneapolis after graduation and will be going through this whole process again. How will you step out of your comfort zone? What is something positive that will come out of it? Change is scary but welcome it with open arms and you might surprise yourself with how much you actually enjoy it!</p>
