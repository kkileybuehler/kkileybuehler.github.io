            <h1>Budget Does Not Equal Boring</h1>
            <p>The stereotype of being a broke college student is a stereotype for a reason. While it certainly does not apply to all students, it is very accurate for many (including myself). For a lot of people, this is the first time ever having responsibility paying bills. You have rent, groceries, gas money, student loans, and possibly more that you must pay each month. It can become very stressful when most jobs will only pay you $15 an hour and you are only available to work part time, being a full-time student.</p>
            <p>With all the stress of school, work, and bills, it is important to still have fun and make the most out of your college years. While a lot of activities can be expensive, there are so many things to do for free or for cheap! So, I am going to share some of my favorite things to do while on a budget!</p>
            <h4>ROLLER SKATING</h4>
            <p>Roller skating is something that I did with a group of friends about a year ago and I have been dying to go back! I honestly wasn't that excited when a friend suggested roller skating because rolling around in a circle for a couple of hours just didn't sound that appealing to me. However, I was immediately proved wrong! We had so much fun skating together, taking pictures, and attempting different tricks on our skates. There were neon lights shining on the rink and music blasting on the speakers. This is something you can do any time of year AND it is very affordable! Admission is about $10, and it is worth every cent.</p>
            <h4>BOWLING</h4>
            <p>Bowling is a classic activity that people of all ages have been doing forever. Get a group of friends together, put on some bowling shoes, and try to avoid the gutter! Bowling is a very humbling sport, and you may have to kiss some of your pride goodbye, but it is so fun to laugh about it with your friends. Boise State actually offers free bowling all day on Fridays in the Student Union Building. They stopped for a while due to the pandemic, but I have a feeling it will start again soon with the decrease in positive covid rates. Even bowling off campus is affordable ranging between $5-7 per person. </p>
            <h4>HOT SPRINGS</h4>
            <p>Natural hot springs might be one of the best things Boise has to offer, in my opinion. With absolutely zero cost, you get a short hike to the hot spring, a beautiful view of nature, and a fun and relaxing time with your friends. The only negative is it may take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get to one…and a small possibility of seeing a naked man (but I promise this is rare). Grab a towel and some snacks and enjoy nature's natural hot tub!</p>
            <h4>EXPLORING CAVES</h4>
            <p>Exploring caves is another exciting and free activity that is available in Boise. The Kuna Caves are about 30 minutes from Downtown Boise and is a really interesting place to check out with a couple of friends. Keep your eyes open as you head to the cave because it can be hard to miss. It is literally a hole in the ground with a ladder leading you down. Be sure to bring flashlights and dress warm! The temperature drops when you go beneath the ground. The Kuna Caves are pretty small, so you don't need to worry about getting lost! There is only one way in and one way out.</p>
            <h4>FLOWER FIELDS</h4>
            <p>As the weather warms up and flowers begin to bloom, there are amazing flower fields that are open for the public to walk through. This is a really fun activity for you and your friends to get some fresh air and have the perfume of flowers fill your nose. The photo opportunities are also unbeatable. There are even a couple flower fields that allow you to pay a small fee to cut your own flowers and build a personal bouquet!</p>
            <h4>CONCERTS</h4>
            <p>I know concerts aren't typically considered an affordable activity. And I know it can be on the pricier side; however, I still wanted to include it, especially living in Boise. Boise is a great place to see concerts when you live here because so many amazing artists perform here! You don't have to worry about renting an Airbnb or the cost of travel. I have seen some of my favorite artists including Hippie Sabotage and Louis the Child and tickets only cost me about $35! Concerts probably not something that you will go to super often, so spending a little bit extra money occasionally is definitely worth it. These concerts are some of my favorite memories in college!</p>
            <p>Living on a budget does not have to be boring! There are so many activities that are little to no cost. Anything can be a good time when you are with your friends but I hope this blog provided you with some interesting options when you are running low on ideas! What are your favorite budget friendly things to do?</p>
